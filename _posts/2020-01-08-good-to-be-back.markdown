title: Good To Be Back!
---

Ah it's good to be back.  In the past few years I've taken a some career adventures (going from consulting back to Microsoft, working as a developer in security incident response and vulnerability management, another stint as a manager).  

Last summer I moved back to an individual contributor role focusing on identity again, this time as a service engineer.  

Being excited about DevOps, security and identity makes this job a ton of fun and I find myself figuring things out that seem worth sharing so I'll be posting here again, hopefully often.  The nature of my posts will likely be fun ways to integrate and automate, things that should be simple but require some hacking, ramblings about my career adventures, etc.  Here goes!
