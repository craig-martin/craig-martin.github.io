Whelp, I guess that domain is gone.

Let me domain name (integrationtrench.com) lapse because I wasn't watching my inbox and missed the renewal notices.  Now the registration was taken over by some third party and I can bid to get it back.  What a scam.  Sad to lose the domain name but am not going to pay more stupid tax to get the name back.
